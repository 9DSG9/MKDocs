## Introduction

This documentation will guide you through setting up your own smart mirror powered by a Raspberry Pi. A smart mirror combines a two-way mirror with a digital display, creating an interactive surface that shows personalized information while functioning as a regular mirror.

This project aims to boost your productivity by turning a regular mirror into a morning information hub that displays calendar events, weather updates, news headlines, personal reminders, and other customizable widgetsâ€”all while you complete your morning routine.

## Who Should Use This Guide

This guide is designed specifically for first and second-term Computer Science students who possess working knowledge of:

* Terminal-based command execution and navigation
* Software installation via package managers (apt)
* Fundamental Linux/Raspberry Pi OS operations and file systems

## Prerequisites

To follow these instructions, you will need:

* A computer with internet access (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
* An email account
* Basic knowledge of mouse, keyboard, and trackpad terminologies

## Hardware Requirements

Before beginning this installation, you'll need:

* A Raspberry Pi (3B+ or newer recommended)
* An SD card
* Monitor or TV with HDMI input (for initial setup)
* USB keyboard and mouse (for initial setup)
* Internet connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)

## Software Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

* Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye or newer)
* Git (for cloning repositories)
* Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)
* npm Package Manager (v7.x or later)
* Text editor for configuration (nano or vim)

## Typographical Conventions
In these smart mirror setup instructions, I'll use the following conventions to help you navigate the documentation:

1. Terminal commands will be displayed in code blocks:

		``` $ sudo apt install ```

	 
2. File paths and configuration files will be formatted: 
	
	`config.js` or `/etc/MagicMirror/config`
<br><br>

3. User interface elements will be displayed in [square brackets]:

	[Settings] or [Display]
<br><br>	

4. Step-by-step instructions will be numbered and use bold for actions:

	1. **Open** the terminal
	2. **Type** the command to update your system
<br><br>

5. Important changes to existing files will be highlighted:

	```js title="Original.js"
	function greet(name) {
		const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
		console.log(message);
		return message;
	}
	```

	```js title="Modified.js" hl_lines="2"
	function greet(name) {
  		const message = `Goodbye, ${name}!`; // (1)
  		console.log(message);
  		return message;
	}
	```

	1.  Changed greeting from "Hello" to "Goodbye"

## Notes and Warning Messages

!!! note
    This documentation covers only the software setup aspects of the smart mirror. Hardware assembly instructions are not included.

!!! warning
    Ensure your Raspberry Pi has a stable power supply of at least 2.5A. Insufficient power can cause system instability and damage your SD card.

!!! info
    While this guide is designed for CS students, it assumes basic familiarity with Linux commands and package management.

!!! success
    By following these instructions, you'll have a fully functional smart mirror displaying customized information while maintaining mirror functionality.

!!! danger
	Unplugging your Raspberry Pi during installation may cause irreparable damage. Do not unplug your device.
