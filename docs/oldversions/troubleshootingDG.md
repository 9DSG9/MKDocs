# Troubleshooting

| Symptoms | Probable Cause | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Unable to load the screen at the expected times | The mirror display doesn't turn on or off when scheduled | Double check what port you have set in `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js` and ensure the MMM-ScreenManager module is properly configured with correct hours: `turnOnHour: 7, turnOffHour: 23`. If using PIR motion sensor, verify connections with `gpio -g read 17`. Then restart MagicMirror with `pm2 restart MagicMirror` |
| Modules displaying error messages or failing to load | Some modules have missing dependencies or configuration issues | Check MagicMirror logs with `pm2 logs MagicMirror`. Verify module dependencies with `cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/[module-name]` and `npm install`. Check GitHub for known issues. Update modules with `git pull` and `npm install`. Disable problematic modules by commenting them out in the config file. |
| Touch screen doesn't register touches or responds incorrectly | Touch interface drivers may be missing or misconfigured | Verify touch drivers with `sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg-input-evdev`. Recalibrate with `DISPLAY=:0 xinput_calibrator`. Check detection with `xinput list`. Ensure USB connections are secure. Restart X server: `sudo systemctl restart lightdm` |
| Voice commands not being recognized | Microphone issues or Alexa module configuration problems | Check microphone with `arecord -l`. Test recording: `arecord -d 5 test.wav` and `aplay test.wav`. Verify module config in `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js`. Ensure wake word is set to "Alexa". Re-run authentication: `cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-awesome-alexa` and `npm run authenticate` |
| Smart mirror loses internet connection | Wi-Fi connectivity issues | Check connection status with `iwconfig`. Verify network availability: `sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID`. Check configuration in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. Ensure credentials are correct. Restart networking: `sudo systemctl restart networking` |
| MagicMirror application crashes, freezes, or shows blank screen | System resource limitations or corrupted SD card | Check resources with `top` and memory with `free -h`. Verify SD card: `sudo fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2`. Disable modules to reduce resource usage. Use PM2: `npm install -g pm2` and `pm2 start ~/MagicMirror/installers/pm2_MagicMirror.json`. Set automatic recovery: `pm2 startup` and `pm2 save` |
| localhost is loading indefinitely | The handler function is missing a response method | Make sure the handler function includes a response method to end the HTTP request-response cycle. Add a method like `res.send()` or `res.json()` to your route handlers. |
