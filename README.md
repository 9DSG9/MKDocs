# RPI Smart Mirror Documentation Project

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for setting up and customizing a Raspberry Pi-powered Smart Mirror using MagicMirror².

## Project Overview

This documentation was created as a project for COMM 2216 User Documentation Assignment. It offers a step-by-step guide to help Computer Science students set up their own smart mirror with personalized widgets and information displays.

## Methods and Processes

### Research and Planning

* Conducted user research to understand the needs and technical background of first and second-term CS students
* Evaluated existing smart mirror documentation to identify gaps and improvement opportunities
* Tested the setup process personally to ensure accuracy of instructions
* Identified common issues for the troubleshooting section based on community forums

### Documentation Structure

The documentation follows the principles of user-centered design, with clear task-oriented instructions:

1. Introduction - Sets expectations and requirements
2. Installation Guide - Step-by-step software setup
3. Configuration Guide - Customizing basic functionality
4. Customization Guide - Advanced personalization
5. Glossary - Technical term definitions
6. Troubleshooting - Solutions to common problems

### Technical Implementation

* Documentation was created using MkDocs with the Material theme
* Content was written in Markdown for simplicity and portability
* Git was used for version control and collaboration
* The documentation site is hosted on GitHub Pages

### Testing and Validation

* Instructions were tested by peers in a controlled environment
* Feedback was incorporated to improve clarity and completeness
* Multiple Raspberry Pi models were tested to ensure compatibility

## Technologies Used

* **MkDocs**: Documentation framework
* **Material for MkDocs**: Theme with enhanced features
* **Git/GitHub**: Version control and hosting
* **Markdown**: Content formatting
* **Raspberry Pi**: Testing platform
* **MagicMirror²**: Smart mirror software

## Future Improvements

* Add video tutorials for complex steps
* Create a troubleshooting decision tree
* Expand module customization examples
* Add section on hardware assembly
